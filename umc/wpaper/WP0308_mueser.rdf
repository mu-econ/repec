Title: Welfare to Temporary Work: Implications for Labor Market Outcomes
Abstract: We explore the effects of temporary help employment on welfare recipients subsequent employment and welfare dynamics. We find that any 
employment in temporary help services or other sectors yields
substantial benefits compared to no employment. Although welfare recipients who go to work for temporary help service firms have lower initial 
wages than those with jobs in other sectors, they experience faster
subsequent wage growth. Two years later, they are no less likely to be employed, their wages are close to those of other workers, and they are only 
slightly more likely to remain on welfare.
