Title: Accounting for Fluctuations in Social Network Usage and Migration Dynamics
Abstract: In this paper, we examine network capital usage and migration patterns in a theoretical model. Networks are modeled as impacting the migration decision in many ways. When young, larger
networks reduce the time lost moving from one region to another. In addition networks decrease
the time spent searching for a job. Finally, when old, migrants receive transfer payments through
the network. We show that the number and properties of steady state equilibria as well as the
global dynamics depend crucially on whether the returns to network capital accumulation exhibit
constant, increasing, or decreasing returns to scales relative to the level of network capital. With
constant returns to scale, migration flows and network capital levels are characterized by either
a unique steady state equilibria or by a two-period cycle. The fluctuations in network capital
usage exhibited by our model are consistent with recent empirical data regarding the usage of
networks by Mexican immigrants. In the case of increasing returns to scale, either there exists a
unique, stable steady state equilibria or multiple equilibria which are characterized as either sinks
or saddles. When the returns to scale are decreasing, there exists a unique, stable steady state
equilibrium. Finally, we show that increasing barriers to migration will result in an increase in the
flow of immigrants, contrary to the desired effect, in the constant and increasing returns to scale
cases.
