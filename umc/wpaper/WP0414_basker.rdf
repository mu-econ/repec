Title: 'Twas Four Weeks before Christmas: Retail Sales and the Length of the Christmas Shopping Season
Abstract: I study the effect of the length of the Christmas "shopping season" in the United States (traditionally, beginning the day after US Thanksgiving) on aggregate retail sales. I find a statistically significant increase in per-capita retail sales in November and December (combined) of approximately $6.50 per additional day over the relevant range. The implications of these finding are briefly discussed.
