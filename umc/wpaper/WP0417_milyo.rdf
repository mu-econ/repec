Title: Do Liberals Play Nice? The Effects of Party and Political Ideology in Public Goods and Trust Games
Abstract: We test the conventional wisdom that political ideology is associated with generosity or compassion by comparing the behavior of experimental subjects in public goods or 
trust games. We find that self-described liberals and those identifying more closely with the Democrat party are just as likely to free-ride as conservatives or Republican-leaners; 
likewise, political ideology is unrelated to observed trusting behavior or trustworthiness in a bilateral trust game.
