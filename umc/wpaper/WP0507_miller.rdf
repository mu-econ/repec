Title: Extracting a Common Stochastic Trend:Theories with Some Applications
Abstract: This paper investigates the statistical properties of the Kalman filter for state
space models including integrated time series. In particular, we derive the full
asymptotics of maximum likelihood estimation for some prototypical class of
such models, i.e., the models with a single latent common stochastic trend.
Indeed, we establish the consistency and asymptotic mixed normality of the
maximum likelihood estimator and show that the conventional method of infer-
ence is valid for this class of models. The models considered explicitly in the
paper comprise a special, yet useful, class of models that we may use to extract
the common stochastic trend from multiple integrated time series. As we show
in the paper, the models can be very useful to obtain indices that represent
fluctuations of various markets or common latent factors that affect a set of
economic and financial variables simultaneously. Moreover, our derivation of
the asymptotics of this class makes it clear that the asymptotic Gaussianity and
the validity of the conventional inference for the maximum likelihood procedure
extends to a larger class of more general state space models involving integrated
time series. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the state space model by ex-
tracting a common stochastic trend in three empirical analyses: interest rates,
return volatility and trading volume, and Dow Jones stock prices.
