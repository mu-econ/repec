Title: Did the Devil Make Them Do It? The Effects of Religion and Religiosity in Public Goods and Trust Games
Abstract: We test whether religious affiliation and participation in religious services are associated with behavior in public goods and trust games. Overall, religious affiliation is unrelated to individual behavior. However, we find some weak evidence that among subjects attending
religious services, increased participation is associated with behavior in both public goods and
trust games.
