Title: Campaign Finance Laws and Political Efficacy: Evidence From the States
Abstract: The decline of political efficacy and trust in the United States is often linked
to the rise of money in politics. Both the courts and reform advocates justify
restrictions on campaign donations and spending as necessary for the improvement
of links between the government and the governed. We conduct the first
test of whether campaign finance laws actually influence how citizens view their
government by exploiting the variation in campaign finance regulations both
across and within states during the last half of the 20th century. Our analysis
reveals no large positive effects of campaign finance laws on political efficacy.
Public disclosure laws and limits on contributions from organizations are in
some cases associated with modest increases in efficacy, but public financing is
associated with a similarly modest decrease in efficacy.
