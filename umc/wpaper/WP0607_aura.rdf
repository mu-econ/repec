Title: Supply Constraints and Housing Prices
Abstract: This paper analyzes the effects of land use constraints on housing prices. 
We provide a new framework for evaluating policy when mobility across regions is allowed
but limited. A key result is that loosening regulatory constraints within individual 
regions would have little effect on prices for plausible parameterizations. For example,
we show reasonable conditions under which, even if every building in Manhattan were 100 
stories tall, prices would fall by less than 15 percent.
