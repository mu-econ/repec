Title: Using State Administrative Data to Measure Program Performance 
Abstract: We use administrative data from Missouri to examine the sensitivity of earnings impact
estimates for a job training program based on alternative nonexperimental methods. We consider
regression adjustment, Mahalanobis distance matching, and various methods using propensity
score matching, examining both cross-sectional estimates and difference-in-difference estimates.
Specification tests suggest that the difference-in-difference estimator may provide a better
measure of program impact. We find that propensity score matching is most effective, but the
detailed implementation is not of critical importance. Our analyses demonstrate that existing
data can be used to obtain useful estimates of program impact.
