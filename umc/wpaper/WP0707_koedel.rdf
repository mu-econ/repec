Title: Teacher Quality and Educational Production in Secondary School
Abstract: This study uses administrative data linking students and teachers at the classroom level to evaluate teacher quality and joint production in secondary school. Teacher quality
is measured by value-added to student test scores in math and reading. Although empirical research has struggled to link observable teacher qualifications to student achievement,
teacher quality measured by student performance varies significantly and has important effects on educational outcomes. I identify which teacher inputs affect which test-score outputs 
in secondary school and find strong evidence of joint production. The results from this study are applicable to incentive design and teacher accountability programs.
