Title: Re-Examining the Role of Teacher Quality In the Educational Production Function
Abstract: This study uses administrative data linking students and teachers 
at the classroom level to estimate teacher value-added to student 
test scores.  We find that variation in teacher quality is an 
important contributor to student achievement  more important 
than has been implied by previous work.  This result is 
attributable, at least in part, to the lack of a ceiling effect in the 
testing instrument used to measure teacher quality.  We also show 
that teacher qualifications are almost entirely unable to predict 
value-added.  Motivated by this result, we consider whether it is 
feasible to incorporate value-added into evaluation or merit pay 
programs.
