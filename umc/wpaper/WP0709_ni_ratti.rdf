Title: High Heterogeneous Information and Investment under Uncertainty
Abstract: A sudden change in investment environment shifts objective uncertainty (characterized 
by parameters that determine the distribution of returns) and at the same time heightens 
subjective uncertainty (about the data generating parameters) unevenly across investors. For a 
given state of economy, the uncertainty facing the investor is the sum of the uncertainty in the 
data and the uncertainty of the investors assessment of the expected return distribution. In this 
model the option value of waiting to invest depends not only on the objective uncertainty as in 
the traditional theory but varies systematically with investor information and Bayesian updating 
of outlook for the project. Simulation of the model suggests that during a state characterized by 
greater uncertainty and higher potential expected return investment will be by an abnormally 
high percentage of informed investors and may increase overall. For over 10,000 instances of 
firm-level FDI data for Korea from 1996 to 2001, regression results are consistent with the 
hypothesis that disproportionably more FDI is made by experienced (hence more informed) 
investors during heightened uncertainty.
