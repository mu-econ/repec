Title: Wal-Mart as Catalyst to U.S.-China Trade
Abstract: Retail chains and the volume of imports of consumer goods from developing 
countries have grown sharply over the past 25 years. Wal-Marts sales, which 
currently account for 15% of U.S. imports of consumer goods from China, grew 
90-fold over this period, while U.S. imports from China increased 30-fold. We 
relate these trends using a model in which scale economies in retail interact with 
scale economies in the import process. Combined, these scale economies amplify 
the effects of technological change and trade liberalization, creating a two-way 
relationship between the chains size and its sourcing choice. Falling trade bar- 
riers increase imports not only through direct reduction of input costs but also 
through an expanded chain and higher investment in technology. Calculations 
based on our model suggest that the existence of the chain more than doubles 
the sensitivity of imports to tariff reductions. Technological innovations account 
for approximately 60% of Wal-Marts growth from 19842004 and reductions in 
input cost, due to tariff reductions and changes in sourcing, account for 40% of 
this growth.
