Title: The Evolving Food Chain: Competitive Effects of Wal-Mart's Entry into the Supermarket Industry
Abstract: We analyze the effect of Wal-Marts entry into the grocery market using a unique
store-level price panel data set. We use OLS and two IV specifications to estimate 
the effect of Wal-Marts entry on competitors prices of 24 grocery items 
across several categories. Wal-Marts price advantage over competitors for these 
products averages approximately 10%. On average, competitors response to 
Wal-Marts entry is a price reduction of 11.2%, mostly due to smaller-scale competitors: 
the response of the big three supermarket chains (Albertsons, 
Safeway, and Kroger) is less than half that size. We confirm our results using a
 falsification exercises, in which we test for Wal-Marts effect on prices of services 
that it does not provide, such as movie tickets and dry cleaning services.
