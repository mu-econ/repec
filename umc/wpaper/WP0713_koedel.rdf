Title: Teacher Quality and Dropout Outcomes in a Large, Urban School District
Abstract: Recent research shows that variation in teacher quality has large effects 
on student performance.  However, this research is based entirely on 
student test scores.  This paper evaluates teacher quality in terms of 
another educational outcome of great interest  graduation.  Using a 
unique instrumental variables approach to identify teacher effects, I find 
that differences in teacher quality have large effects on graduation 
outcomes.  Because teacher effects on graduation outcomes will be more 
pronounced for students who are on the graduation margin, the results 
imply an avenue through which high-quality teachers are more productive 
with disadvantaged students.
