Title: Excess Sensitivity in Consumption without Liquidity Constraint: Evidence from Monthly Household Panel Data 
Abstract: The monthly salaries and allowances of Korean government employees are known in advance 
but vary greatly throughout the year. Using a large Korean monthly panel data set from 1994 to 
2003, we examine how nondurable consumption expenditure in households headed by government 
employees responds to predictable income changes. We find excess sensitivity in consumption 
during the pre-Asian financial crisis era in households headed by young government employees with 
low liquid assets or low income. These household features are commonly associated with liquidity 
constraints. Further analysis shows that despite the apparent association, liquidity constraint is 
not the most convincing explanation for the excess sensitivity. Instead, the empirical finding is 
consistent with the theory that certain households deviate from consumption smoothing when the 
effort involved exceeds the welfare gained.
