Title: The Role of Temporary Help Employment in Low-wage Worker Advancement 
Abstract: We examine the effects of temporary help service employment on later earnings and 
employment for individuals participating in three federal programs providing supportive services 
to those facing employment difficulties.  The programs include Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families, whose participants are seriously disadvantaged; a job training program with a highly 
heterogeneous population of participants; and employment exchange services, whose participants 
consist of Unemployment Insurance claimants and individuals seeking assistant in obtaining 
employment.  We undertake our analyses for two periods: the late 1990s, a time of very strong 
economic growth, and shortly after 2000, a time of relative stagnation.  Our results suggest that 
temporary help service firms may facilitate quicker access to jobs for those seeking employment 
assistance and impart substantial benefits as transitional employment, especially for individuals 
whose alternatives are severely limited.  Those who do not move out of temporary help jobs, 
however, face substantially poorer prospects, and we observe that nonwhites are more likely than 
whites to remain in THS positions in the two years following program participation. Our results 
are robust to program and time period.
