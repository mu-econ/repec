Title: Cointegrating Regressions with Messy Regressors: Missingness, Mixed Frequency, and Measurement Error 
Abstract: We consider a cointegrating regression in which the integrated regressors are
messy in the sense that they contain data that may be mismeasured, missing, 
observed at mixed frequencies, or have other irregularities that cause the econometrician
to observe them with mildly nonstationary noise. Least squares estimation
of the cointegrating vector is consistent. Existing prototypical variancebased
estimation techniques, such as canonical cointegrating regression (CCR),
are both consistent and asymptotically mixed normal. This result is robust to
weakly dependent but possibly nonstationary disturbances.
