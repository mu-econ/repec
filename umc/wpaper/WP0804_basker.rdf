Title: Imports "R" Us: Retail Chains as Platforms for Developing-Country Imports
Abstract: Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and other large retail chains are often identified 
with cheap imports. We use data from the Census of Retail Trade and the 
International Trade Commission over the period 1997-2002 to test whether 
big chains serve as platforms for imports from LDCs. Using 
difference-in-difference specifications we show that Chinese and other LDC 
imports have increased disproportionately in retail sectors with the 
sharpest consolidation into chains. To quantify the importance of chain 
growth to import growth we apply a numerical algorithm that generates 
marginal propensities to import by firm size. The largest retail firms' 
propensity to import from China is 17 percentage points higher than that of 
smaller retailers; the corresponding difference in import propensities from 
LDCs as a whole is 27 points. The disproportionate growth of large 
retailers between 1997 and 2002 explains 5% of the overall growth in 
consumer goods imports, 20% of the growth in consumer goods imports from 
China, and 22% of the growth in consumer goods imports from LDCs..
