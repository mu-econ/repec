Title: Does Wal-Mart Sell Inferior Goods?
Abstract: I estimate the aggregate income elasticity of Wal-Mart's and Target's
revenues using quarterly data for 1997-2006. I find that Wal-Mart's revenues increase 
during bad times, whereas Target's revenues decrease, consistent with Wal-Mart 
selling "inferior goods" in the technical sense of the term. An upper bound on 
the aggregate income elasticity of demand for Wal-Mart's wares is -0.5.
