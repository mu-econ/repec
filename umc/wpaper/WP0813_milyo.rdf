Title: How Do States Formulate Medicaid and SCHIP Policy? Economic and Political Determinants of State Eligibility Levels
Abstract: We exploit the existence of substantial variation in state policies toward public health insurance for children between 1990 and 2002 to 
estimate the economic and political determinants of state eligibility levels. Controlling for state and year effects, eligibility levels are not 
significantly associated with either the percentage of uninsured children in the state or the eligibility policy of neighboring states; further, 
variation in eligibility levels within state is negatively associated with both the federal matching rate and state fiscal capacity. We also 
observe that state political preferences, measured by the Democrats share of seats in the lower chamber of the state legislature, are a relatively 
important a determinant of state eligibility levels. However, other political factors, such as party control of state government, voter turnout, 
legislative term limits and campaign finance regulations do not influence state eligibility levels.
