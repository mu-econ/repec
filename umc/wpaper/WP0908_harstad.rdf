Title: Information Variability Impacts in Auctions
Abstract: A wide variety of auction models exhibit close relationships between the winner's expected profit and the expected difference
between the highest and second-highest order statistics of bidders' information, and between expected revenue and the second-highest order
statistic of bidders' expected asset values. We use stochastic orderings to see when greater environmental variability of bidders'
information enhances expected profit and expected revenue.
