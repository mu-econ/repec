Title: Selection of Multivariate Stochastic Volatility Models via Bayesian Stochastic Search 
Abstract: We propose a Bayesian stochastic search approach to selecting
restrictions on multivariate regression models where the errors
exhibit deterministic or stochastic conditional volatilities. We
develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that generates
posterior restrictions on the regression coefficients and Cholesky
decompositions of the covariance matrix of the errors. Numerical
simulations with artificially generated data show that the
proposed method is effective in selecting the data-generating
model restrictions and improving the forecasting performance of
the model. Applying the method to daily foreign exchange rate
data, we conduct stochastic search on a VAR model with stochastic
conditional volatilities.
