Title: Recent Changes In The Characteristics Of Unemployed Workers 
Abstract: We examine how gender, racial, and ethnic variation in unemployment and Unemployment Insurance (UI) receipt changed over time inthe U.S. economy and how these changes are influenced by shifts in theoccupational and industrial composition of employment. Using Current Population Survey (CPS) data, we find that, in the past 50 years, theunemployment rates for women, nonwhites, and Hispanics have beenconverging to those of the rest of the population. Between 1992 and 2007, women had the same unemployment rates as men; nonwhites still hadhigher unemployment rates than whites; and the rate for Hispanics wasapproaching that of non-Hispanics. Once we control for industry-occupation differences, women have higher unemployment and UI receipt ratesthan men, while Hispanics have similar unemployment rates but lower UIreceipt rates than non-Hispanics. Nonwhites still have appreciably higher unemployment rates but the same UI receipt rates as whites.
