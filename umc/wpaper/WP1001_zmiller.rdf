Title: A Nonlinear IV Likelihood-Based Rank Test for Multivariate Time Series and Long Panels 
Abstract: A test for the rank of a vector error correction model (VECM) or panel VECM based on the well-known 
trace test is proposed. The proposed test employs instrumental variables (IV's) generated by a class of 
nonlinear functions of the estimated stochastic trends of the VECM under the null. The test improves the 
standard trace test by replacing the non-standard critical values with chi-squared critical
values. Extending the result to the panel VECM case, the test is robust to cross-sectional correlation of the 
disturbances. With this test, I extend earlier research using nonlinear IV's for unit root testing. However, 
the optimal instrument in the univariate case is not admissable in the more general multivariate case. The 
chi-squared result suggests that IV tests may be used to replace limits of other standard tests with 
integrated time series that are given by nonstandard stochastic integrals, even without a panel with which to 
pool tests.
