Title: Grading Standards in Education Departments at Universities 
Abstract: This paper documents a startling difference in the grading standards between education departments 
and other academic departments at universities – undergraduate students in education classes receive significantly higher grades than 
students in all other classes. This phenomenon cannot be explained by differences in student quality or structural differences across departments 
(i.e., differences in class sizes). Drawing on evidence from the economics literature, the differences in grading standards between 
education and non-education departments imply that undergraduate education majors, the majority of whom become teachers, supply 
substantially less effort in college than non-education majors. If the grading standards in education departments were brought in line with those 
of other major academic departments, student effort would be expected to increase by at least 10-16 percent.
