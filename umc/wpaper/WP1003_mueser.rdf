Title: New Estimates of Public Employment and Training Program Net Impacts: A Nonexperimental Evaluation of 
the Workforce Investment Act Program 
Abstract:This paper presents nonexperimental net impact estimates for the Adult and Dislocated Worker 
programs under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), the primary federal job training 
program in the U.S, based on administrative data from 12 states, covering approximately 160,000 WIA 
participants and nearly 3 million comparison group members. The key measure of 
interest is the increment in average quarterly earnings or employment attributable to WIA program 
participation for those who participate, estimated for up to four years following entry 
into the program using propensity score matching methods. The results for participants in the WIA Adult 
program show that participating is associated with a several-hundred-dollar 
increase in average quarterly earnings. Adult program participants who obtain training have lower earnings 
in the months during training and the year after exit than those who don’t 
receive training, but they catch up within 10 quarters, ultimately registering large gains. The marginal 
benefits of training exceed, on average, $400 in earnings each quarter three 
years after program entry. Participants in the Dislocated Worker program experience several quarters for 
which earnings are depressed relative to comparison group workers after entering 
WIA, and, although their earnings ultimately match or overtake the comparison group, the benefits they 
obtain are smaller than for those in the Adult program.
