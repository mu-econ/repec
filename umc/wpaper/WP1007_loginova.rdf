Title: Competitive Effects of Mass Customization
Abstract: Earlier theoretical literature on mass customization maintains that customization reduces product 
differentiation and intensifies price competition. In contrast, operations management studies argue that 
customization serves primarily to differentiate a company from its competitors. Interactive involvement of 
the customer in product design creates an affective relationship with the firm, relaxing price competition. 
This paper provides a model that incorporates consumer involvement to explain the phenomena described in the 
operations management literature.
 
Two firms on the Hotelling line compete for a continuum of consumers with heterogeneous brand preferences. 
An exogenously given fraction of consumers is potentially interested in customization. Consumer benefits 
from customization are the rewards from a special shopping experience and the value of product customization 
(better fitting product); these benefits are higher for consumers located closer to the customizing brand. 
When a consumer purchases a customized product, he incurs the waiting cost. The firms decide whether to 
offer customization, then engage in price competition. I show that customization increases the ``stickiness" 
of a consumer to the customizing firm, leading to less intense price competition. As mass customization 
becomes more efficient (the lead time goes down and/or the sunk costs decrease), customization by one or 
both firms occurs in equilibrium. I perform comparative statics analysis with respect to the fraction of 
consumers potentially interested in customization.
