Title: The Relative Performance of Head Start 
Abstract: In early 2010, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released the findings from a large, 
experimental evaluation of the Head Start program. A common interpretation of the findings is that they show 
"small" effects, which has lead to, among other things, calls to improve the efficacy of Head Start. However, 
it is not clear that Head Start is performing worse than should be reasonably expected. To provide a frame of 
reference for evaluating the program, we compare the performance of Head Start childcare centers to the 
performance of non-Head Start childcare centers, the latter being the preferred childcare option of wealthier 
families. We find that, on average, Head Start centers perform similarly to non-Head Start centers, despite 
serving primarily disadvantaged children. Our results suggest that expectations for the Head Start program may 
be too high.
