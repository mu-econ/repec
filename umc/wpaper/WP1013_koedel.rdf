Title: Math Skills and Labor-Market Outcomes: Evidence from a Resume-Based Field Experiment 
Abstract: We examine the link between math skills and labor-market outcomes using a resume-based field 
experiment. Specifically, we send fictitious resumes in response to online job postings, randomly assigning 
some resumes to indicate stronger math skills, and measure employer responses. The resumes that are randomly 
assigned to indicate stronger math skills receive more interest from employers than the comparison resumes. 
Our findings add to the body of evidence showing that stronger math skills positively affect labor-market 
outcomes.
