Title:  Estimating Estate-Specific Price-to-Rent Ratios in Shanghai and Shenzhen: A Bayesian Approach 
Abstract:  The price-to-rent ratio, a common yardstick for the value of housing, is difficult to estimatewhen rental properties are poor substitutes of owner-occupied homes. In this study weestimate price-to-rent ratios of residential properties in two major cities in China, where urbanhigh-rises (estates) comprise both rental and owner-occupied units. We conduct Bayesianinference on estate-specific parameters, using information of rental units to elicit priors of theunobserved rents of units sold in the same estate. We find that the price-to-rent ratios tendto be higher for low-end properties. We discuss economic explanations for the phenomenonand the policy implications.
