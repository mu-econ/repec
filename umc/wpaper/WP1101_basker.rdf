Title: Raising the Barcode Scanner: Technology and Productivity in the Retail Sector
Abstract: Barcode scanners were introduced in the 1970s as a way to reduce
labor costs in stores, particularly at checkout. This paper is the
first to estimate their effect on productivity. I use store-level
data from the 1972, 1977, and 1982 Census of Retail Trade, matched to
data on store scanner installations, to estimate scanners' effect on
labor productivity. I find that early scanners increased a store's
labor productivity, on average, by approximately 4.5 percent in the
first few years, with a larger effect in stores carrying more
packaged products likely to bear barcodes. Setup costs significantly
offset the short-run productivity effect.
