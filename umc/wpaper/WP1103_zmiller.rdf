Title: Conditionally Efficient Estimation of Long-run Relationships Using Mixed-frequency Time Series 
Abstract:  I analyze efficient estimation of a cointegrating vector when the regressand is observed at a lower frequency than the regressors. Previous authors have examined the 
effects of specific temporal aggregation or sampling schemes, finding conventionally efficient techniques to be efficient only when both the regressand and the regressors are 
average sampled. Using an alternative method for analyzing aggregation under more general weighting schemes, I derive an efficiency bound that is conditional on the type of 
aggregation used on the regressand and differs from the unconditional bound defined by the infeasible full-information high-frequency data-generating process. I modify a 
conventional estimator, canonical cointegrating regression (CCR), to accommodate cases in which the aggregation weights are either unknown or known. In the unknown case, the 
correlation structure of the error term generally confounds identification of the conditionally efficient weights. In the known case, the correlation structure may be utilized to 
offset the potential information loss from aggregation, resulting in a conditionally efficient estimator. Efficiency is illustrated using a simulation study and an application to 
estimating a gasoline demand equation.
