Title:  Cointegrating MiDaS Regressions and a MiDaS Test 
Abstract:  This paper introduces cointegrating mixed data sampling (CoMiDaS) regressions, generalizing nonlinear MiDaS regressions in the extant literature. 
Under a linear mixed-frequency data-generating process, MiDaS regressions provide a parsimoniously parameterized nonlinear alternative when the linear 
forecasting model is over-parameterized and may be infeasible. In spite of potential correlation of the error term both serially and with the regressors, I 
find that nonlinear least squares consistently estimates the minimum mean-squared forecast error parameter vector. The exact asymptotic distribution of the 
difference may be non-standard. I propose a novel testing strategy for nonlinear MiDaS and CoMiDaS regressions against a general but possibly infeasible 
linear alternative. An empirical application to nowcasting global real economic activity using monthly covariates illustrates the utility of the approach.
