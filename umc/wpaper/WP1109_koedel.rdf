Title: Teacher Pension Systems, the Composition of the Teaching Workforce, and Teacher Quality 
Abstract: Teacher pension systems impose large penalties on individuals who separate too soon or remain employed too long. The penalties result in 
the retention of some teachers who would otherwise choose to leave, and the premature exit of some teachers who would otherwise choose to stay. We 
examine how these compositional effects of teacher pension systems influence the quality of the teaching workforce, conditional on individuals who 
initially select into teaching. We find no evidence that the pull and push incentives raise teacher quality, and if anything, we find modest 
negative effects. Our results support future experimentation with compensation schemes for educators that are not so heavily backloaded.
