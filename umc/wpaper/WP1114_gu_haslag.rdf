Title: Endogenous Credit Cycles
Abstract: We build a model in which verifiability of private debts, timing mismatch in debt settlements
and borrowing leverage lead to liquidity crisis in the financial market. Central bank can respond
to the liquidity crisis by adopting an unconventional monetary policy that resembles repurchase
agreements between the central bank and the lenders. This policy is effective if the timing
mismatch is nominal (i.e., a settlement participation risk). It is ineffective if the timing mismatch
is driven by a real shock (i.e., preference shock).
