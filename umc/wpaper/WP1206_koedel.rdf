Title: Is Curriculum Quality Uniform? Evidence from Florida
Abstract: We construct a large panel dataset of schools and districts in Florida to evaluate curricular effectiveness in elementary mathematics. A key innovation of our study is that we allow for 
curriculum quality to be non-uniform across various mathematics subtopics. We find evidence of variability in curricular effectiveness across different subtopics within the same curriculum. Our findings 
suggest that educational administrators, particularly those working in districts with heterogeneous student populations, should consider the topical performance of their various curricular alternatives 
when making adoption decisions.
