Title: Temporary Help Work: Earnings, Wages and Multiple Job Holding
Abstract: Temporary Help Services (THS) employment has been growing in size, particularly among disadvantaged workers.  An extended policy debate focuses on the low earnings, 
limited benefits, and insecurity that such jobs appear to provide.  We investigate the earnings and wage differentials observed between THS and other jobs in a sample of 
disadvantaged workers.  We find lower quarterly earnings at THS jobs but a $1 per hour wage premium.  We reconcile these findings in terms of the shorter duration and lower hours 
worked at THS jobs.  We interpret the premium as a compensating wage differential.
