Title: Do State Campaign Finance Reforms Reduce Public Corruption?
Abstract: The Supreme Court has long held that campaign finance regulations are permissible for the purpose of preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption. Yet the implied 
hypothesis that campaign finance reforms are effective tools for combating public corruption has gone essentially untested. We conduct the first systematic evaluation of the effects 
of campaign finance laws on actual corruption rates in the states. We examine the effects of state reforms on both convictions and filings in public corruption cases over the last 
25 years; overall, we find no strong or convincing evidence that state campaign finance reforms reduce public corruption. Earlier research that employs similar methods also finds 
little support for the contention that state campaign finance regulations increase public trust and confidence in government. Together, these results call into question the legal 
rationale for campaign finance regulations.
