Title: Change at the Checkout: Tracing the Impact of a Process Innovation
Abstract: Barcode scanners, introduced in the early 1970s, were a foundational
process innovation in the grocery supply chain. By 1984 scanners had
been installed in 10% of food stores in the U.S.
Difference-in-difference analysis of city-level price data shows that
scanners reduced prices of groceries by about 1.4% in their first
decade. The results are consistent with prior estimates of labor
saving by scanners and better information available to stores. Early
adopters and adopters in states that imposed fewer restrictions on
complementary process innovations contributed disproportionately to
the price decreases.
