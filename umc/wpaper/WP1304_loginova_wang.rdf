Title: Customization in an Endogenous-Timing Game with Vertical Differentiation
Abstract: We study mass customization in a duopoly game in which the firms' products have different qualities. Whether customization choices are made simultaneously or sequentially 
is endogenously determined. Specifically, the customization stage of the game involves two periods. Each firm either selects its product type in period 1 or postpones this decision 
to period 2. We show that customization by one or both firms occurs only if the quality difference is sufficiently large. Flexibility of timing in the customization stage sometimes 
enables the firms to achieve an outcome that is Pareto superior to that if they were constrained to simultaneous customization choices. Although the high quality firm is more likely 
to customize, in some circumstances the low quality firm can obtain an advantage by becoming the first and only firm to adopt customization.
