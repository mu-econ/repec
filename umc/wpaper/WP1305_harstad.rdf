Title: Applied Signaling: Graduate School Admissions and Frequency of STEM Majors
Abstract: We offer a closer look at screening by graduate admissions committees in
their selection of student applicants, and at applicants' strategic behavior given
screening methods. Essentially, a signaling game takes place between student applicants seeking to signal ability and admissions committees seeking to 
inferability from proffered applications. In equilibrium, students' decisions 
to adopt a STEM or a non-STEM major reflect both their desire to imply high ability
and the importance that admissions committees place on GPA. We find that, relative
to GPA, admissions committees placing a higher weight on graduate entrance-exam scores leads to a higher fraction of students selecting STEM majors. Illustrations
of the impact on the equilibrium fraction of STEM majors of grade inflation, and
of alternative undergraduate grading systems, are also provided.
