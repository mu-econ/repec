Title: Improved Quantile Inference Via Fixed-Smoothing Asymptotics And Edgeworth Expansion
Abstract: Estimation of a sample quantile's variance requires estimation of the probability density at the quantile. The common quantile spacing method involves smoothing parameter m. When m, n → ∞ , 
the corresponding Studentized test statistic asymptotically follows a standard normal distribution. Holding m fixed asymptotically yields a nonstandard distribution dependent on m that contains the 
Edgeworth expansion term capturing the variance of the quantile spacing. Consequently, the fixed-m distribution is more accurate than the standard normal under both asymptotic frameworks. For the 
fixed-m test, I propose an m to maximize power subject to size control, as calculated via Edgeworth expansion. Compared with similar methods, the new method controls size better and maintains good or 
better power in simulations. Results for two-sample quantile treatment effect inference are given in parallel.
