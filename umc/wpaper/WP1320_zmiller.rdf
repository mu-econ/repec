Title: Disentangling Temporal Patterns in Elasticities: A Functional Coefficient Panel Analysis of Electricity Demand
Abstract: We introduce a panel model with a nonparametric functional coefficient of multiple arguments. The coefficient is a function both of time, allowing temporal changes in an otherwise linear 
model, and of the regressor itself, allowing nonlinearity. In contrast to a time series model, the effects of the two arguments can be identified using a panel model. We apply the model to the 
relationship between real GDP and electricity consumption. Our results suggest that the corresponding elasticities have decreased over time in developed countries, but that this decrease cannot be 
entirely explained by changes in GDP itself or by sectoral shifts.
