Title: Measuring Public Corruption in the United States: Evidence from Administrative Records of Federal Prosecutions
Abstract: A growing empirical literature examines the causes and consequences of public corruption in the United States; however, most of these studies measure corruption using data on federal 
convictions that is of dubious quality and provenance. We document these concerns and describe an alternative data source that provides more reliable and detailed information on corruption prosecutions 
and convictions by type of state official and even by lead charge. We employ these data to construct a taxonomy of public corruption that dispels some popular and academic misconceptions. Our findings 
call into question the lessons from previous empirical research; earlier studies of the causes and consequences of corruption in the states should be re-examined with more appropriate measures of 
corruption convictions.
