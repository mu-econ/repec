Title: On the Size Distortion from Linearly Interpolating Low-frequency Series for Cointegration Tests
Abstract: We analyze the sizes of standard cointegration tests applied to data subject to linear interpolation, discovering evidence of substantial size distortions induced by the interpolation. We 
propose modifications to these tests to effectively eliminate size distortion from such tests conducted on data interpolated from end-of-period sampled low-frequency series. Our results generally do 
not support linear interpolation when alternatives such as aggregation or mixed-frequency-modified tests are possible.
