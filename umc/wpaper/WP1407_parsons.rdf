Title: Does Attending a Low-Achieving School Affect High-Performing Student Outcomes?
Abstract: This paper follows a cohort of initially high-performing Missouri students from grade-3 through grade-9 and examines whether attending a low-achieving school impacts their 
subsequent standardized exam scores, as well as the grade in which they first take Algebra I. Two key findings emerge. First, attending a low-achieving school does not affect the 
standardized exam performance of initially high-performing students once school quality (as measured by value-added) is accounted for. Second, high-performing students who attend 
low-achieving schools are more likely to take Algebra I later relative to their counterparts who attend higher-achieving schools.
