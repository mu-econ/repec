Title: Diminished-Dimensional Political Economy 
Abstract: Economists' policy advice is based on models of responses by a variety of economic entities to policy adoptions. There is
compelling evidence that these entities do not optimize in at all the fashion that mainstream economics assumes. Rather, they
limit decision-making to solving problems of much smaller dimensionality. We consider how political economy goes awry when
ignoring diminished dimensionality, and some research avenues opened up by this realization.
