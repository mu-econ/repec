Title: Estate Taxation and Human Capital with Information Externalities
Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of estate taxation when firms cannot directly observe worker skill levels. Imperfect labor market signaling gives rise to an 
information externality that causes workers to free-ride off of others' human capital acquisition. Inherited wealth exacerbates the information externality because risk-averse 
workers with larger inheritances exert less effort to acquire skills. By reducing these inheritances, an estate tax induces greater skill acquisition effort, resulting in a higher 
number of skilled workers, and in many cases, increased wages 
and output. In a parametrized model, I establish that the optimal estate tax rate is significantly above zero.
