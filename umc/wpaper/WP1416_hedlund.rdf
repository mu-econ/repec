Title: The Cyclical Dynamics of Illiquid Housing, Debt, and Foreclosures
Abstract: This paper quantitatively accounts for the cyclical dynamics of key macroeconomic housing and mortgage market variables using a tractable, search-theoretic model of 
housing with equilibrium mortgage default. To explain these dynamics, the model highlights the importance of liquidity spirals which arise from the interaction of search frictions 
and en- dogenous credit constraints. During housing busts, longer selling times spill over into higher foreclosure risk, thereby magnifying the response of credit constraints to the 
depressed housing market. This contraction in credit then deepens the downturn. During booms, the reverse occurs. Based on these insights, I consider a foreclosure reform that makes 
all mortgages full recourse, and I show that implementing such a reform would reduce foreclosures and dampen housing dynamics.
and output. In a parametrized model, I establish that the optimal estate tax rate is significantly above zero.
