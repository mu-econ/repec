Title:  Race and Gender Effects on Employer Interest in Job Applicants: New Evidence from a Resume Field Experiment 
Abstract:  We sent nearly 9,000 fictitious resumes to advertisements for job openings in seven major cities in the United States across six occupational categories. We randomly 
assigned names to the resumes that convey race and gender but for which a strong socioeconomic connotation is not implicated. We find little evidence of systematic employer 
preferences for applicants from particular race and gender groups
