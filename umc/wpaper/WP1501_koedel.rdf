Title:  Value-Added Modeling: A Review
Abstract:  This article reviews the literature on teacher value-added. Although value-added models have been used to measure the contributions of numerous inputs to educational production, their application toward identifying the contributions of individual teachers has been particularly contentious. Our review covers articles on topics ranging from technical aspects of model design to the role that value-added can play in informing teacher evaluations in practice, highlighting areas of consensus and disagreement in the literature. Although a broad spectrum of views is reflected in available research, along a number of important dimensions the literature is converging on a widely-accepted set of facts.
