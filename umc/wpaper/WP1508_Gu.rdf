Title: Money and Credit Redux
Abstract: We analyze money and credit as competing payment instruments in decentralized
exchange. In natural environments, we show the economy does not need both: if credit is easy, money is irrelevant; if credit is tight, money can be essential,
but then credit is irrelevant. Changes in credit conditions are neutral
because real balances respond endogenously to keep total liquidity constant.
This is true for exogenous or endogenous policy and debt limits, secured or unsecured
lending, and a general class of pricing mechanisms. While we show how
to overturn some results, the benchmark model suggests credit might matter
less than people think.
