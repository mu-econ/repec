Title: Are Reemployment Services Effective?  Experimental Evidence from the Great Recession (WP 15-09 is now WP 18-04) 
Abstract: We examine an experimental-design reemployment program implemented in Nevada during the Great Recession that required Unemployment Insurance (UI) recipients to: (1) undergo an eligibility review to confirm they were qualified for benefits and actively searching for work and, if deemed eligible, (2) receive job-counseling services. Our results show that the program expedited participant exit from UI, produced UI savings that exceeded program costs, and improved participant employment outcomes. Analyses of program effects on the UI exit likelihood show that the program’s effects are partly associated with increased participant exit up through the time when program activities were scheduled, reflecting voluntary exit of participants from UI to avoid program activities and disqualifications of participants who failed to meet eligibility requirements. In addition, the program induced substantial participant exit from UI in the period after participants fulfilled requirements and their interactions with the program had ended, suggesting that the job-counseling services offered by the program may have helped participants to conduct more effective job search. Our findings provide evidence that reemployment programs that combine an eligibility review with mandatory participation in jobsearch services can be effective during recessions.
