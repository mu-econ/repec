Title: Efficiency Measurement via Revealed Thresholds, Without Knowing Valuations  
Abstract: Laboratory experiments employing an induced-values methodology often report on allocative efficiencies observed.  That methodology requires experimenters know subjects’ motivations precisely, questionable in labs, impossible in field experiments.  Allocative efficiency implies a hypothetical costless aftermarket would be inactive.  An allocation mechanism’s outcome is defined to be behaviorally efficient if an appropriate aftermarket is actually appended to the mechanism and measures at most a negligible size of remaining mutually beneficial gains.  Methodological requirements for an appropriate aftermarket are specified.  A first demonstration observes more frequent and ex-ante larger behavioral inefficiencies in second- than in first-price auctions.  A simple field demonstration indicates when a public-good increase can be observed to cover marginal cost to subjects’ mutual benefit, without knowing valuations.  A wide variety of empirical economic-policy studies can utilize this methodology to observe comparative evidence of alternative policies’ allocativeefficiency shortfalls.
