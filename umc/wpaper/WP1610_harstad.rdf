Title: Credible Signaling via Transfers, Job Application Fees 
Abstract:How low might be the resource costliness of making signals credible? Using
a job market as an example, We build a signaling model to determine the extent
to which a transfer from an applicant might replace a resource cost as an
equilibrium method of achieving signal credibility. As long as a firmâ€™s claim
to be hiring for an open position is credible, and profitability of the hiring
process per se is limited to an application fee, the firm has an incentive to use
the properly calibrated fee to implement a separating equilibrium. Applicant
risk aversion does not necessarily discourage a monopsonist potential employer
from using an application fee, but a firm hiring in a competitive labor
market with risk-averse applicants may prefer a pooling equilibrium, hiring
all applicants at their average productivity. Partial extension to a model with
third-party assistance (a headhunter or a job board) is possible.
