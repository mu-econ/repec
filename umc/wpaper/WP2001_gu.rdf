Title: Toxic Assets and Market Freezes 
Abstract: We study economies where some assets are toxic i.e., they have negative returns but still have positive prices because they provide liquidity as
payment instruments or as collateral. Even without changes in fundamentals markets can, as a self-fulfilling prophecy, freeze and thaw recurrently: toxic
assets stop trading for a spell, then restart. We show markets without toxic assets might have hot and cold spells, where prices and quantities fluctuate,
but cannot freeze and thaw (at least without nonconvexities). Freezes can occur when there are toxic assets plus fiat currency, and whether these assets
trade for goods or trade for money.
