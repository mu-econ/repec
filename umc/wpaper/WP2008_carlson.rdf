Title: Relaxing Conditional Independence in an Endogenous Binary Response Model
Abstract: For binary response models, the literature primarily addresses endogeneity by a control function approach assuming conditional independence (CF-CI). However, as the literature also notes, CF-CI implies conditions like homoskedasticity (of the latent error with respect to the instruments) that fail in many empirical settings. I propose an alternative approach that allows for heteroskedasticity, achieving identification with a conditional mean restriction. These identification results apply to a latent Gaussian error term with flexibly parametrized heteroskedasticity. I propose a two-step conditional maximum likelihood estimator and derive its asymptotic distribution. In simulations, the new estimator outperforms others when CF-CI fails and is fairly robust to distributional misspecification. An empirical illustration studies married women's labor force participation.
