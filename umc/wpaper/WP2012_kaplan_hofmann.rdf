Title: High-order coverage of smoothed Bayesian bootstrap intervals for population quantiles
Abstract: We characterize the high-order coverage accuracy of smoothed and unsmoothed Bayesian bootstrap confidence intervals for population quantiles. Although the original (Rubin, 1981) unsmoothed intervals have the same O(n^{-1/2}) coverage error as the standard empirical bootstrap, the smoothed Bayesian bootstrap of Banks (1988) has much smaller O(n^{-3/2}[log(n)]^3) coverage error and is exact in special cases, without requiring any smoothing parameter. It automatically removes an error term of order 1/n that other approaches need to explicitly correct for. This motivates further study of the smoothed Bayesian bootstrap in more complex settings and models.
