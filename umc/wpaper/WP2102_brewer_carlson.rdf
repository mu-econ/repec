Title: Addressing Sample Selection Bias for Machine Learning Methods
Abstract: We study approaches for adjusting machine learning methods when the training sample differs from
the prediction sample on unobserved dimensions. The machine learning literature predominately assumes
selection only on observed dimensions. Common suggestions are to re-weight or control for variables that
influence selection as solutions to selection on observables. Simulation results indicate that common
machine learning practices such as re-weighting or controlling for variables that influence selection into
the training or testing sample often worsens sample selection bias. We suggest two control-function
approaches that remove the effects of selection bias before training and find that they reduce mean-squared prediction error in simulations with a high degree of selection. We apply these approaches to
predicting the vote share of the incumbent in gubernatorial elections using previously observed re-election
bids. We find that ignoring selection on unobservables leads to substantially higher predicted vote shares
for the incumbent than when the control function approach is used.
