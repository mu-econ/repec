Title: Information Technology, Improved Access, and Use of Prescription Drugs
Abstract: We estimate the effects of information technology designed to improve access to medication while limiting overuse. We focus on benzodiazepines, commonly prescribed and effective but addictive medications. We study the staggered rollout of a nationwide electronic prescribing system over four years in Finland and use population-wide, individual-level administrative data sets. We find an increase in benzodiazepine use on average due to increased prescription renewals. The effect is most pronounced among younger patients. We find little evidence of improvement in their general health outcomes but observe substantial increases in diagnoses of prescription drug abuse disorders and poisonings. Our results show robust evidence that easier access may lead to medication overuse.
