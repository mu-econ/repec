Title: Adapting to Natural Disasters through Better Information: Evidence from the Home Seller Disclosure Requirement
Abstract: While flood damage is determined by both flood intensity and population exposure, the US has predominantly focused on managing the former, with limited success. This paper studies whether a Home Seller Disclosure Requirement can reduce flood exposure and thus flood damage. Leveraging two quasi-experimental variations of the policy, I first show that mandating flood risk disclosure lowers the population living in high-risk areas. Further, using a hydrological measure of flood intensity, I find that it reduces the probability of flood damage by 31 percent. These findings illustrate that easing information frictions can promote voluntary adaptation to natural disasters.
