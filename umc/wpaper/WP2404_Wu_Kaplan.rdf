Title:  Ordinal Decomposition
Abstract:The famous Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition estimates the statistically "explained" proportion of a between-group difference in means, but ordinal variables have no mean.  A common approach assigns cardinal values 1,2,3,... to the ordinal categories and runs the conventional OLS-based decomposition.  Surprisingly, we show such results are numerically identical to a decomposition of the survival function when estimating the counterfactual using OLS-based distribution regression, even if the cardinalization is wrong.  Still, reporting the counterfactual helps transparency and wide-sense replication, and to mitigate functional form misspecification, we describe and implement a nonparametric estimator.  Empirically, we decompose U.S. rural-urban differences in mental health.
