Title: Automation and Diverging Health Risks
Abstract: We examine the impact of automation on workers' health risks in the United States. We first document that automation leads to a divergence in the severity of occupational health risks: while automation reduces nonfatal occupational injury incidence, it increases fatal injury incidence. Secondly, the disparity of health risks across age groups has widened due to automation. The overall hospitalizations have declined in commuting zones with higher automation exposure. Yet, the benefits are concentrated among young workers, while middle-aged workers experience increased hospitalizations, particularly due to despair-related conditions. Combining the occupational injury estimates, a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that workplace automation provides significant, health-driven economic benefits.
