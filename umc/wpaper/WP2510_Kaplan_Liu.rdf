Title: Multiple Testing for Distributional Differences with Non-iid Data
Abstract: We propose inference methods to compare two continuous distributions across their support, with two main innovations. First, unlike previous such multiple testing procedures, ours apply much more broadly by allowing non-iid sampling, whenever a Donsker's theorem holds. We also establish our procedures' coherence and consonance. Second, we invert these procedures into confidence sets for the set of points where certain (in)equalities hold. For one-sided inference, these points have an economic interpretation in terms of restricted first-order stochastic dominance. All our methods provide much richer results than existing global tests that report only a single "reject" or "not reject" decision.
