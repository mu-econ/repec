Title: Multiple Testing of a Function's Monotonicity
Abstract: Instead of having a single "yes" or "no" result from a test of the global null hypothesis that a function is increasing, we propose a multiple testing procedure of the functionâ€™s increasingness at several points. If the global null is rejected, then multiple testing provides more information about why. If the global null is not rejected, then multiple testing can provide stronger evidence in favor of increasingness, by rejecting null hypotheses that the function is decreasing. Our approach uses high-level assumptions that apply to a broad class of causal and descriptive statistical models. By inverting the proposed multiple testing procedure that controls the familywise error rate, we also generate "inner" and "outer" confidence sets for the set of points at which the function is increasing. With high asymptotic probability, the inner confidence set is contained within the true set, whereas the outer confidence set contains the true set. We also improve power with stepdown and two-stage procedures. Simulations and empirical examples illustrate the new methodology, and all code is provided.
