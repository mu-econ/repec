Title: Restricting Sales of Flavored Nicotine Vaping Products: Effects on Nicotine Vaping Product and Cigarette Sales in Canada
Abstract:The rise of nicotine vaping products (NVPs) has led governments to consider banning or limiting flavored NVP sales to reduce their appeal. In particular, we study the effect of NVP flavor restrictions enacted in Canada, a country with historically high tobacco regulation, through July of 2023. Using a stacked DID model, we estimate that flavor restrictions increased cigarette sales by 9.6%. In gas and convenience stores, these restrictions nearly eliminated flavored non-menthol and menthol NVP sales while increasing tobacco and unflavored NVP sales by 123.4%. Substitution patterns arise in Canada despite its strict tobacco control environment, suggesting that patterns of substitution between e-cigarettes and cigarettes are generalizable across countries with different tobacco regulatory strengths.
